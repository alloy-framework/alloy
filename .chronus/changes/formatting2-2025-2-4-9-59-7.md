Added support for formatting primitives to produce formatted output. This includes elements like `group` and `fill` for attempting to fit text on a single line, `hbr`, `sbr`, `lbr`, and `br` for introducing line breaks, `align` for padding output, and more. All the built-in components have been updated to generate nicely formatted code.
