Declaration components' `name` prop and symbol constructors' `name` parameter now allow namekeys. Namekeys are a special kind of refkey which
takes a name and name options. For example, `namekey("myVariable", { disableNamePolicy: true})` when passed to a declaration component would create a symbol named "myVariable", use the namekey as a refkey, and disable the name policy for that symbol.
