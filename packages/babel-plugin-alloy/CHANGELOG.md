### Breaking Changes

- [#56](https://github.com/alloy-framework/alloy/pull/56) Automatic indenting and significant literal linebreaks have been removed and replaced with explicit formatting primitives.  Additionally, any amount of whitespace within text nodes is replaced by a single space. Leading and trailing whitespace in a text node is trimmed as before.
