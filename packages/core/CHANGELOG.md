- [#50](https://github.com/alloy-framework/alloy/pull/50) Improve types of JSX elements so typescript and editors can provide accurate errors when providing props to components. For example, component props can be unions of props interfaces, enabling an overload-like pattern.
- [#50](https://github.com/alloy-framework/alloy/pull/50) Add Tappers, which allow getting a reference to contexts provided by nested components from a parent component.
