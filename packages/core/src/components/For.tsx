/**
 * The For component iterates over the provided array and invokes the child
 * callback for each item. It can optionally be provided with a `joiner` which
 * is placed between each item, and an `ender` which is placed after the last
 * item when there is at least one item.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const items = ["apple", "pear", "plum"];
 * return <For each={items}>
 *   {(item) => <>Fruit: {item}</>}
 * </For>
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * When the `each` prop is a reactive (e.g. a reactive array, or ref to an
 * array), `For` will automatically update when the array changes. When doing
 * so, it will attempt to avoid re-rendering items which have not changed. For
 * example, when appending an item to a reactive array, existing items will not
 * be re-rendered. Note that presently the implementation is fairly simple -
 * when making modifications to the middle of an array it likely that every
 * element after the modification will be rerendered.
 *
 * @see {@link (mapJoin:1)} for mapping arrays to elements outside of JSX templates.
