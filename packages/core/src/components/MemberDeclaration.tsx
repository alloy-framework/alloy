 * refkey, or else passing in the symbol. When called with a name and refkey, a
 * symbol will be created in the current scope (provided by
 * {@link MemberDeclarationContext}) with that name and refkey. If a refkey is not
 * provided, `refkey(props.name)` is used.
 *
 * When called with a symbol, that symbol is merely exposed via
 * {@link MemberDeclarationContext}. It is assumed that the caller of this component
 * has created the symbol with the `createSymbol` API on the
 * {@link BinderContext}.
 *
 * @see {@link BinderContext}
