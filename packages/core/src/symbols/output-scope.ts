 *
 * Scopes form a tree. All scopes except the global scope have a parent scope
 * identified by `parent`. Scopes can have nested scopes which can be accessed
 * using the `children` property. Whether a child scope can be accessed from
 * the parent scope is determined by each language's scoping rules.
 *
 * This interface is the base implementation of scope. Generally, most languages
 * will have subtypes of this interface that provide additional metadata about
 * the scope. For example, TypeScript scopes need to track whether the scope
 * represents a package, module, class, function, etc.
 *
 * Scopes are reactive values, which allows you to observe changes to the scope
 * within a reactive context.
