description: Building an example TypeScript emitter

import { Aside, Code, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Let's build a project that consumes a simplified REST API specification and
produces a TypeScript client that interacts with a service that implements that
specification. Along the way we will learn about the key concepts needed to
generate code using the alloy framework.

The final source code for this sample can be found in our [github
repo](https://github.com/alloy-framework/alloy/tree/main/samples/client-emitter).

## Goal

Let's say we have a super simple OpenAPI-like REST API description that follows
the following schema format:

```ts
export interface RestApi {
  name: string;
  operations: RestApiOperation[];
  models: RestApiModel[];
}

export interface RestApiOperation {
  name: string;
  endpoint: string;
  verb: "get" | "post";
  requestBody?: RestApiModelReference;
  responseBody?: RestApiModelReference;
}

export interface RestApiModelReference {
  ref: string;
  array?: boolean;
}

export interface RestApiModel {
  name: string;
  properties: RestApiModelProperty[];
}

export interface RestApiModelProperty {
  name: string;
  type: RestApiModel | RestApiModelReference | "string" | "number" | "boolean";
}
```

The goal is to turn a service described using this schema format into a REST
client that can make service calls. This requires reflecting on the schema for a
given service and turning that into the appropriate source code that can be
built into a working client for that service.

<Aside>

The schema format described above is woefully underequipped to describe real
REST APIs. The goal is to describe alloy's key concepts without getting lost in
the intricacies of real world REST API description languages.

</Aside>

## Initial steps

First, let's initialize our alloy project. See [the getting started
guide](./getting-started) for details, but the easiest way is to clone the
starter template.

<Code code={`git clone https://github.com/alloy-framework/alloy-project-template my-project
cd my-project
pnpm install
pnpm build
`} frame="terminal" lang="sh" />

## Defining our service

Let's generate a client for a hypothetical pet store API, with the following endpoints:

* list pets
* create a pet
* get a specific pet

And to make things slightly more interesting, let's say that a pet also has a
favorite toy.

We can describe this using our schema format above as follows:

<Code code={`
  export const api: RestApi = {
    name: "Petstore",
    operations: [
      {
        name: "create_pet",
        verb: "post",
        endpoint: "/pets",
        requestBody: {
          ref: "Pet",
        },
        responseBody: {
          ref: "Pet",
        },
      },
      {
        name: "list_pets",
        verb: "get",
        endpoint: "/pets",
        responseBody: {
          ref: "Pet",
          array: true,
        },
      },
      {
        name: "get_pet",
        verb: "get",
        endpoint: "/pets/:id",
        responseBody: {
          ref: "Pet",
        },
      },
    ],
    models: [
      {
        name: "Pet",
        properties: [
          { name: "name", type: "string" },
          { name: "age", type: "number" },
          { name: "favoriteToy", type: { ref: "Toy" } },
        ],
      },
      {
        name: "Toy",
        properties: [{ name: "name", type: "string" }],
      },
    ],
  };
`} frame="code" lang="typescript" title="src/schema.ts" />

## Creating our entrypoint

Next, let's create the entrypoint for our code generator, and see some output
so we can start iterating. Create `src/index.tsx` as follows:

<Code code={`
  import { mapJoin, Output, render, writeOutput } from "@alloy-js/core";
  import * as ts from "@alloy-js/typescript";
  import { api } from "./schema.js";

  const output = render(
    <Output>
      <ts.SourceFile path="models.ts">
        console.log("hello world!");
      </ts.SourceFile>
    </Output>
  );

  writeOutput(output, "./alloy-output");
`} frame="code" lang="tsx" title="src/index.tsx" />

We begin by importing some things we need from `@alloy-js/core` and
`@alloy-js/typescript`. We choose to import language components under a
namespace to help clarify which components are TypeScript specific but this is
not a requirement.

Now if we build and run `dist/src/index.js`, we should find
`alloy-output/models.ts` with hello world in it. Neat, but not very useful.
Let's fix that.

## Building a package

We want our client to be a package we can package with npm and distribute to our
users. We're going to need a package.json for that. We'll also need a
tsconfig.json since we're emitting TypeScript code that needs to be built. We
could create these manually, but alloy comes with
[PackageDirectory](../../reference/typescript/components/packagedirectory/)
component that will generate these for us. And, as we'll see, it will also keep
these up to date with the structure of our project and its exports.

So let's use that component, and declare some source files inside of it. We'll
need `models.ts` which we already have. We'll also need `client.ts`. And let's
also create an `index.ts` that exports both of these and use that as our package
main. For this, we can use the
[BarrelFile](../../reference/typescript/components/barrelfile/) component.

Update our output to be the following:

<Code code={`
  const output = render(
    <Output>
      <ts.PackageDirectory name={\`\${api.name}-client\`} version="1.0.0">
        <ts.SourceFile path="models.ts">
        </ts.SourceFile>
        <ts.SourceFile path="client.ts">
        </ts.SourceFile>
        <ts.BarrelFile export="." />
      </ts.PackageDirectory>
    </Output>,
  );
`} frame="code" lang="tsx" title="src/index.tsx" />

Note how we provide the `export` prop to the BarrelFile component - this ensures that
this module is exported from the package under the given path.

Now if we build and run `dist/src/index.js`, we'll find we have emitted a
working package under `alloy-output`:

<FileTree>

- alloy-output
  - client.ts empty for now
  - index.ts exporting the other ts files
  - models.ts empty for now
  - package.json with exports set appropriately
  - tsconfig.json with some sane defaults


</FileTree>

`index.js` is exporting some empty files though, and we'll get to that, but
first we need a little context.

## Adding useful context

Before writing more of our emitter, one observation we can make is that the
schema for the service we are emitting is going to be needed in a lot of places.
Typically you would probably just import the schema itself from a ts file
somewhere and be done, but there's another option: storing it in
[context](./basic-concepts/#context). Context is useful because we won't need to
explicitly provide the current schema to our emitters. It is also useful in that
the same context can have different values in different parts of your program.
So by putting the schema in Context, we gain some additional flexibility down
the line in case we want to support generating clients for multiple services
within a single package.

To create context, create `src/context/api.ts` with the following contents:

<Code code={`
  import { createContext, useContext } from "@alloy-js/core";
  import { RestApi, RestApiModel, RestApiModelReference } from "../schema.js";

  // context interface
  interface ApiContext {
    schema: RestApi;
    resolveReference: (ref: RestApiModelReference) => RestApiModel | undefined;
  }

  // context variable
  export const ApiContext = createContext<ApiContext>();

  // context accessor
  export function useApi(): ApiContext {
    return useContext(ApiContext)!;
  }

  export function createApiContext(schema: RestApi): ApiContext {
    return {
      schema,
      resolveReference(node) {
        const model = schema.models.find((v) => v.name === node.ref);

        if (!model) {
          throw new Error(\`Unresolved reference \${node.ref}\`);
        }

        return model;
      },
    };
  }
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/context/api.ts" />

As described in [Basic concepts](./basic-concepts/#context), there are three parts to our context:

1. `interface ApiContext` - the context interface, the type components see when they get the context.
2. `const ApiContext` - the context variable, which identifies the context and
   gives access to the Provider component for setting the context.
3. `function useApi` - the context accessor, which returns the current context value.

For our purposes, one of the main things we'll need from context is resolving references to schemas, so
we add an API for that on the context itself.

With API context established, we can import it into `src/index.tsx` along with
the api schema itself from `src/schema.ts` and provide it to all child
components. We do this by using `ApiContext.Provider` as follows:

<Code code={`
  const output = render(
    <Output>
      <ApiContext.Provider value={createApiContext(api)}>
        <ts.PackageDirectory name={\`\${api.name}-client\`} version="1.0.0">
          <ts.SourceFile path="models.ts">
          </ts.SourceFile>
          <ts.SourceFile path="client.ts">
          </ts.SourceFile>
          <ts.BarrelFile export="." />
        </ts.PackageDirectory>
      </ApiContext.Provider>
    </Output>,
  );
`} frame="code" lang="tsx" title="src/index.tsx" />

## Emitting models

For TypeScript, we want to emit the models as TypeScript interfaces that
describe plain old JavaScript objects. We could place these interfaces directly
within the models.ts file, but we're going to need some logic to build them.
Encapsulating that logic inside of a component will keep our code clean and
give us a lot of flexibility down the line.

So let's create both `src/components/Model.tsx` and
`src/components/ModelProperty.tsx`. Starting with `ModelProperty.tsx`:

<Code code={`
  import { Children, refkey } from "@alloy-js/core";
  import * as ts from "@alloy-js/typescript";
  import { useApi } from "../context/api.js";
  import { RestApiModelProperty } from "../schema.js";
  import { Model } from "./Model.jsx";

  interface ModelProps {
    property: RestApiModelProperty;
  }

  export function ModelProperty(props: ModelProps) {
    let memberType: Children;

    const apiType = props.property.type;

    if (typeof apiType === "object") {
      if ("ref" in apiType) {
        const model = useApi().resolveReference(apiType);
        memberType = refkey(model);
      } else {
        memberType = <Model model={apiType} />;
      }
    } else {
      memberType = apiType;
    }

    return <ts.InterfaceMember name={props.property.name} type={memberType} />;
  }
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/ModelProperty.tsx" />

To explain the various parts:

1. We start by importing the pieces we need, including the context accessor we
defined in the previous section.
2. We create `ModelProps` to define the props passed to the `ModelProperty`
component. This is just the schema for the property.
3. We define the ModelProperty component which:
   1. Unpacks the type, handling the case of an API type reference, an inline
      anonymous type, or a primitive type. Luckily, the primitive type values
      correspond to the TypeScript syntax for that primitive type, so we can
      just use those directly.
   2. Defines the interface member using the
      [InterfaceMember](../../reference/typescript/components/interfacemember/)
      component from `@alloy-js/typescript`.

Next, let's use this in the `Model` component. In `src/components/Model.tsx`:

<Code code={`
  import { mapJoin, refkey } from "@alloy-js/core";
  import * as ts from "@alloy-js/typescript";

  import { RestApiModel } from "../schema.js";
  import { ModelProperty } from "./ModelProperty.jsx";

  interface ModelProps {
    model: RestApiModel;
  }

  export function Model(props: ModelProps) {
    const members = mapJoin(
      props.model.properties,
      prop => <ModelProperty property={prop} />
    );

    return <ts.InterfaceDeclaration export name={props.model.name} refkey={refkey(props.model)}>
      {members}
    </ts.InterfaceDeclaration>;
  }
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/Model.ts" />

This component follows a similar structure to the previous, but introduces two
new concepts: `mapJoin` and `refkey`.

[mapJoin](../../reference/core/functions/mapjoin/) is a utility that behaves
similar to a map followed by a join on an Array, except it works in terms of
`Children` rather than Array elements and strings. Essentially, this means it
properly handles components (`ModelProperty` in this case). By default,
`mapJoin` joins with a single line break, but a different joiner can be provided.

A [refkey](./basic-concepts/#declarations-and-references) is a unique identifier
for some symbol, and is used to create references to that symbol. Since we are
going to be referencing our model interfaces from other model interfaces and
also the client, we give them a refkey.

With these parts done, we can update our `index.tsx` to make use of these new
components. First, we need to create a declaration for each of the models in our
schema, which we can do using `mapJoin`:

<Code code={`
const modelDecls = mapJoin(api.models, (model) => <Model model={model} />);
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/schema.ts" />

And then we can update our output once again to the following:

<Code code={`
  const output = render(
    <Output>
      <ApiContext.Provider value={createApiContext(api)}>
        <ts.PackageDirectory name={\`\${api.name}-client\`} version="1.0.0">
          <ts.SourceFile path="models.ts">
            {modelDecls}
          </ts.SourceFile>
          <ts.SourceFile path="client.ts">
          </ts.SourceFile>
          <ts.BarrelFile export="." />
        </ts.PackageDirectory>
      </ApiContext.Provider>
    </Output>,
  );
`} frame="code" lang="tsx" title="src/index.tsx" />

Now if we build and run `dist/src/index.js`, we get a `models.ts` with the
following content:
<Code code={`
  export interface Pet {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    favoriteToy: Toy;
  }
  export interface Toy {
    name: string;
  }
`} frame="code" lang="tsx" title="alloy-output/models.ts" />

Now it's time for the fun part - the client!

## Creating our client class

In order to create the client, we will again want two components: `Client` and
`ClientMethod`.

### The ClientMethod component

This component is the most complex by far, because here is where we need to pull
apart the service endpoint schema and map it into method parameters,
implementation details, and return type. Rather than paste the whole thing,
let's take it step by step.

#### 1. Imports and setup

<Code code={`
  import { Children, code, refkey } from "@alloy-js/core";
  import * as ts from "@alloy-js/typescript";
  import { useApi } from "../context/api.js";
  import { RestApiOperation } from "../schema.js";

  export interface ClientMethodProps {
    operation: RestApiOperation;
  }

  export function ClientMethod(props: ClientMethodProps) {
    const api = useApi();
    const op = props.operation;
    // ...
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/ClientMethod.tsx" />

Similar to all previous components, we import the necessary pieces, declare our
component's props, and get access to the current API spec inside the component.

#### 2. Determine the method's parameters

<Code code={`
  const parameters: Record<string, ts.ParameterDescriptor> = {};

  const endpointParam = op.endpoint.match(/:(\w+)$/)?.[1];
  if (endpointParam) {
    parameters[endpointParam] = {
      type: "string",
      refkey: refkey(op, endpointParam),
    };
  }

  if (op.requestBody) {
    parameters["body"] = {
      type: refkey(api.resolveReference(op.requestBody)),
      refkey: refkey(op, "requestBody"),
    };
  }
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/ClientMethod.tsx" />

We construct the parameters expected by the
[ClassMethod](../../reference/typescript/components/classmethod/) component by
extracting any parameters defined in the endpoint and by the request body. We
create refkeys for these parameters so we can refer to them easily later.

#### 3. Determine the method's return type

<Code code={`
  let returnType: Children;
  if (op.responseBody === undefined) {
    returnType = "Promise<void>";
  } else {
    const responseModel = api.resolveReference(op.responseBody);

    const reference: Children = [refkey(responseModel)];
    if (op.responseBody.array) {
      reference.push("[]");
    }

    returnType = code\`Promise<\${reference}>\`;
  }
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/ClientMethod.tsx" />

We construct the return type of the class method based on the `responseBody`
schema property. If it's not present, we simply return `Promise<void>`.
Otherwise, we resolve the reference to obtain the model schema it returns. We
reference in our output source code by placing `refkey(responseModel)` in the
output. Note how this will be the same `refkey` as we defined in our
`models.ts`, so alloy will take care of importing it for us. Lastly, we wrap the
reference in a Promise.

#### 4. Determine the endpoint to call

<Code code={`
  let endpoint: Children;
  if (endpointParam) {
    endpoint =
      <>
        "{op.endpoint.slice(0, -endpointParam.length - 1)}" + {refkey(op, endpointParam)}
      </>;
  } else {
    endpoint = <>"{op.endpoint}"</>;
  }
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/ClientMethod.tsx" />

The endpoint to call may depend on a path parameter passed into the method, so
we need to construct that strhing. When the endpoint has a parameter defined, we
slice off the parameter definition in the endpoint url and concat the value
passed in. We again refer to the parameter with a refkey, which we defined in
step 2.

#### 5. Determine the parameters to fetch

<Code code={`
  const options = op.verb ===
    "post" && <>, 
      <ts.ObjectExpression>
        <ts.ObjectProperty name="method" jsValue="POST" />,
        <ts.ObjectProperty name="body">JSON.stringify({refkey(op, "requestBody")})</ts.ObjectProperty>
      </ts.ObjectExpression>
    </>;
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/ClientMethod.tsx" />

When we are doing a POST, we need to tell `fetch` to use that verb and provide
the body. We can do this by constructing an object expression using the
[ObjectExpression](../../reference/typescript/components/objectexpression/)
component. The `body` property is set to a snippet of source code that JSON
stringifies the `requestBody` parameter, which we defined in step 2.

#### 6. Assembling the method body

Finally, we can pull everything together into the method body:

<Code code={`
  return <ts.ClassMethod
    async
    name={op.name}
    parameters={parameters}
    returnType={returnType}
  >
    const response = await fetch({endpoint}{options});
    
    if (!response.ok) <ts.Block>
      throw new Error("Request failed: " + response.status);
    </ts.Block>

    return response.json() as {returnType};
  </ts.ClassMethod>;
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/ClientMethod.tsx" />

The class method is defined as async, given a name based on what's in the API spec,
and all the parts we assembled previously are slotted into the appropriate place.

### The Client component

The Client component is relatively straight forward:

<Code code={`
  import { mapJoin, refkey } from "@alloy-js/core";
  import * as ts from "@alloy-js/typescript";
  import { useApi } from "../context/api.js";
  import { ClientMethod } from "./ClientMethod.jsx";

  export function Client() {
    const schema = useApi().schema;
    const methods = mapJoin(schema.operations, (op) => <ClientMethod operation={op} />);
    const name = \`\${schema.name}Client\`;

    return <ts.ClassDeclaration name={name} export refkey={refkey(schema)}>
      {methods}
    </ts.ClassDeclaration>;
  }
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/components/Client.tsx" />

We join together using `mapJoin` each of the methods, and add those into a
ClassDeclaration. The class itself gets a name of the service concatenated with
`Client`. It is exported from the module. It is also given a refkey for good
measure, although we don't use it yet.

With this, we can drop the client into our output by importing the `Client`
component and updating our output like the following:

<Code code={`
  <Output>
    <ApiContext.Provider value={createApiContext(api)}>
      <ts.PackageDirectory name={\`\${api.name}-client\`} version="1.0.0">
        <ts.SourceFile path="models.ts">
          {modelDecls}
        </ts.SourceFile>
        <ts.SourceFile path="client.ts">
          <Client />
        </ts.SourceFile>
        <ts.BarrelFile export="." />
      </ts.PackageDirectory>
    </ApiContext.Provider>
  </Output>
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/schema.ts" />

## Adding a name policy

If we generated code at this point, we'd see something amiss - snake case in our
TypeScript! Hissss. The spec author has poor taste, but there's no accounting
for that. Thankfully we can fix this fairly easily by providing a naming policy.
The naming policy is used by all the built-in Alloy components to recase any
names provided by a `name` prop.

In `src/index.tsx`, we can create a naming policy and pass it as a prop to the `Output` component like so:

<Code code={`
  const namePolicy = ts.createTSNamePolicy();

  const output = render(
    <Output namePolicy={namePolicy}>
      <ApiContext.Provider value={createApiContext(api)}>
        <ts.PackageDirectory name={\`\${api.name}-client\`} version="1.0.0">
          <ts.SourceFile path="models.ts">
            {modelDecls}
          </ts.SourceFile>
          <ts.SourceFile path="client.ts">
            <Client />
          </ts.SourceFile>
          <ts.BarrelFile export="." />
        </ts.PackageDirectory>
      </ApiContext.Provider>
    </Output>,
  );
`} frame="code"lang="tsx" title="src/schema.ts" />

And with that, we check our output, and we have a working client!

<Code code={`
  import { Pet } from "./models.js";

  export default class PetstoreClient {
    async createPet(body: Pet): Promise<Pet> {
      const response = await fetch("/pets", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error("Request failed: " + response.status);
      }

      return response.json() as Promise<Pet>;
    }
    async listPets(): Promise<Pet[]> {
      const response = await fetch("/pets");

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error("Request failed: " + response.status);
      }

      return response.json() as Promise<Pet[]>;
    }
    async getPet(id: string): Promise<Pet> {
      const response = await fetch("/pets/" + id);

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error("Request failed: " + response.status);
      }

      return response.json() as Promise<Pet>;
    }
  }
`} frame="code" lang="ts" title="alloy-output/client.ts" />
